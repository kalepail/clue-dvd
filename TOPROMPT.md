- Adjust investigation board section for host computer
- Continue to work on overall style and flow
- Implement a win screen that affects all devices when a player solves the case (host + phones).
- Make "reveal next clue" a pop-down/interruption window (not just a host update); add more drama.
- Add a dramatic win screen when a player gets the correct answer.
- Overhaul the phone notes screen and the phone elims tab.

- We may want to build out a bunch of supporting factual reference docs which the AI can use as context to ensure it doesn't hallucenate or make up stuff that doesn't exist. We need to ensure
  accuracty to the actual game elements as folks will be playing this on the actual gameboard.



  - Summon the butler: Only 7 times (dependant on item cards). Perhaps could be allowed to have more or less - dependant on difficulty as is programmed in game-constants.ts, line 207

  - Inspector Notes templates are too specific to pre-made mysteries. Too little variation from original. Want general "make-up"/example but not as is coded rn in game-elements.ts

 - Continue to work towards adding variety and true cohesion in generated story and remove the specificity of the clues being given
- Need to add inspector interruption for mini game item card reveal
- Clues clearly single out the answers by their wording without meaning to. needs to be much more subtle
- Inspectors Notes only gives 1 type of clue. Needs clue overhaul


  IDEAS:
 -  Make the butler's pantry a potential place of the crime
 -  Have the inspector be a suspect
 -  Add client-side record of accusations previously made (phone-only, private)
